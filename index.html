    <!-- When a window loads for the first time
 -generate a random word
 -display that many blanks (_ characters)
 -display number of guesses remaining
    -starting with 5
 -letters already guessed
    -starting blank
 -wins (times they've guessed the word correctly)
    -starting with 0
Do that one time
Then
listen for the letters that the player types
(var userGuess = event.key.toLowerCase();)
When user presses a key 
 -convert to lowercase
 -compare with the remaining blank letters & letters already guessed
    -if letter is in the generated word
        -fill in the correct blank with a capital letter
    -if letter is not in the generated word
        -add a limb to the hangman
        -subtract 1 from remaining guesses
    -if the letter was already guessed
        -tell the user they've already guessed that letter
    -if the letter was not yet guessed
        -add to the Letters Already Guessed display
 -check to see if the game is over
    -make sure number of guesses >= 1
        -if yes, do nothing
        -if no, game ends in loss
    -see if there are any blank letters left in the currentWord
        -if yes, do nothing
        -if no, game ends in win
 -if game ends in loss
    -display GAME OVER
 -if game ends in win
    -display YOU WIN
    -increase wins by 1
BOTH: restart the game with a new blank word, reset letters already guessed, remaining guesses -->
